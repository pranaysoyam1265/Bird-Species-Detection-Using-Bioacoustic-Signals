## Abstract

This project presents an automated bird species detection system using deep learning techniques applied to bioacoustic signals. The system analyzes environmental audio recordings and identifies bird species with associated confidence scores. Using a dataset of 1,926 recordings from Xeno-Canto covering 54 North American bird species, we evaluated five state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures. EfficientNet-B0 emerged as the optimal model, achieving 72.26 percent top-1 accuracy and 85.55 percent top-5 accuracy. The system incorporates Grad-CAM explainability, uncertainty quantification, and a web-based deployment interface for practical conservation applications.

## 1. Introduction

### Background

Biodiversity monitoring is crucial for conservation efforts worldwide. Traditional bird surveys require expert ornithologists and are time-consuming, expensive, and limited in temporal coverage. Automated acoustic monitoring offers a scalable alternative that can continuously record and analyze bird vocalizations across multiple locations simultaneously.

### Problem Statement

Manual identification of bird species from audio recordings requires significant expertise and time. There is a need for automated systems that can accurately detect and classify bird species from environmental audio recordings while providing confidence scores and explainable predictions.

### Objectives

- Develop a deep learning model to classify 54 North American bird species from audio recordings
- Compare multiple CNN architectures to identify the best performing model
- Implement explainability features using Grad-CAM visualization
- Create a user-friendly web interface for practical deployment
- Establish an 80 percent confidence threshold for reliable species presence detection

## 4. Feature Extraction Methods

### Mel-Spectrogram Generation

Audio signals were converted to Mel-spectrograms, which represent the frequency content of sound over time using a perceptually-motivated frequency scale.

| Parameter | Value | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Number of Mel Bands | 128 | Sufficient frequency resolution for bird calls |
| FFT Window Size | 2048 samples | Good frequency resolution at 22050 Hz |
| Hop Length | 512 samples | Adequate temporal resolution |
| Minimum Frequency | 150 Hz | Below lowest bird vocalization |
| Maximum Frequency | 15,000 Hz | Above highest bird vocalization |
| Output Dimensions | 128 x 216 pixels | Optimized for CNN input |

### Spectrogram Conversion Formula

The Mel-spectrogram is computed by:
1. Applying Short-Time Fourier Transform to obtain power spectrum
2. Mapping frequencies to Mel scale using triangular filter banks
3. Converting power to decibels using logarithmic compression

### Sample Mel-Spectrogram

| Background Noise Addition | Mix with environmental sounds | No |
| Time Masking | Mask random time segments | No |
| Frequency Masking | Mask random frequency bands | No |

Note: Data augmentation was not applied in the final model due to time constraints. This is identified as a key area for future improvement.

## 8. Why EfficientNet-B0 Was Selected

### Ranking Summary

| Rank | Model | Top-1 Accuracy | Key Advantage |
|------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | EfficientNet-B0 | 72.26 percent | Best balance of accuracy and efficiency |
| 2 | DenseNet-121 | 69.85 percent | Good feature reuse but slower |
| 3 | ResNet-50 | 68.42 percent | Reliable but large model size |
| 4 | MobileNetV2 | 65.71 percent | Fastest but lower accuracy |
| 5 | VGG-16 | 61.38 percent | Outdated architecture |

### Reasons for Selecting EfficientNet-B0

#### Reason 1: Highest Overall Accuracy

EfficientNet-B0 achieved the highest top-1 accuracy at 72.26 percent, outperforming the second-best model (DenseNet-121) by 2.41 percentage points. For top-5 accuracy, it achieved 85.55 percent, meaning the correct species is within the top 5 predictions for most recordings.

#### Reason 2: Optimal Model Size

With only 4 million parameters and a 17 MB model file, EfficientNet-B0 is significantly smaller than ResNet-50 (98 MB) and VGG-16 (528 MB). This makes it suitable for deployment on devices with limited storage and memory.

#### Reason 3: Fast Inference Speed

Each 5-second audio chunk is processed in approximately 0.5 seconds, enabling near real-time analysis. This is crucial for practical deployment in field applications.

#### Reason 4: Lower Overfitting

While all models showed overfitting, EfficientNet-B0 had one of the lowest gaps (31.04 percent) between training and validation accuracy, indicating better generalization to unseen data.

#### Reason 5: GPU Memory Efficiency

The model requires only 1.2 GB of GPU memory during inference, making it compatible with the RTX 3050 (4 GB VRAM) and enabling deployment on consumer-grade hardware.

#### Reason 6: Modern Architecture Design

EfficientNet uses compound scaling which optimizes width, depth, and resolution together, unlike older architectures that scale only one dimension. This results in better accuracy per parameter.

## 10. Explainability with Grad-CAM

### What is Grad-CAM

Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a visualization technique that highlights the regions of an input image that are most important for a neural network's prediction. For audio classification, this shows which time-frequency regions of the spectrogram the model focuses on.

### How Grad-CAM Works

1. Forward pass through the model to get prediction
2. Compute gradients of the predicted class score with respect to feature maps
3. Global average pool the gradients to get importance weights
4. Create weighted combination of feature maps
5. Apply ReLU to highlight positive contributions only
6. Overlay heatmap on original spectrogram

### Grad-CAM Visualization Examples

#### Example 1: Correct Prediction with High Confidence

Species: Blue-winged Warbler
Confidence: 97.0 percent
Recording: XC475302

[SPACE FOR GRAD-CAM IMAGE - CORRECT PREDICTION]

Interpretation: The model correctly focuses on the distinctive buzzy trill pattern between 3-6 kHz, which is characteristic of Blue-winged Warbler songs.

#### Example 2: Correct Prediction with Medium Confidence

Species: American Robin
Confidence: 78.3 percent
Recording: XC412856

[SPACE FOR GRAD-CAM IMAGE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]

Interpretation: The model identifies the melodic phrases but shows some uncertainty due to background noise in the recording.

#### Example 3: Incorrect Prediction

Actual Species: Blue-winged Warbler
Predicted Species: Bald Eagle
Confidence: 95.3 percent
Recording: XC481834

[SPACE FOR GRAD-CAM IMAGE - INCORRECT PREDICTION]

Interpretation: The model incorrectly focused on a background sound rather than the bird vocalization, highlighting the importance of noise filtering.

### Grad-CAM Insights

| Observation | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|
| Model focuses on distinct frequency bands | Learned species-specific frequency patterns |
| Temporal attention varies | Model identifies calls within recordings |
| High confidence correlates with focused attention | Diffuse attention indicates uncertainty |
| Background noise causes misfocus | Need for improved preprocessing |
